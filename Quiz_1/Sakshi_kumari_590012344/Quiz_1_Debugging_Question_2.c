1. Identify the bug in the above implementation 
Bug in the Code:
The variable `max` is used without initialization. This can lead to unpredictable results because it may contain a garbage value.

2. What kind of incorrect behavior or result might it produce? 
If the uninitialized `max` is greater than all array elements, none of them will replace it, and the function will return a wrong value.

3. Rewrite the corrected version of the function.
int findMax(int arr[], int n) 
{
    int max = arr[0]; 

    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) 
    {
        if (arr[i] > max) 
        {
            max = arr[i];
        }
        }

    return max;
    }
