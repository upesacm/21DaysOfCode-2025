/* 1. The variable 'max' is not initialized and since the code is written in c, it may hold garbage value, meaning any random value because of 
which the comparison statements and the overall highest element value stored in the variable 'max' may be incorrect.

2. As I said, the function might return any incorrect value as the maximum element, even 0 or a negative number even if all the elements 
in the array may be positive and the comparison statement maybe behave unpredictably as well.

3. Corrected version : 

int findMax(int arr[], int n) {
    int max = arr[0];
    for(int i = 1; i < n: i++) {
        if (arr[i] > max) {
            max = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return max;
}
