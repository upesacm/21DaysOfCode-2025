#The logical error in the is_digits_only function is related to how it handles empty strings.
'''An empty string doesn't contain any characters, so it doesn't contain any digits either. Therefore, it should arguably return False if the requirement is to check if the string "contains only digits" (implying at least one digit is required).

The correct answer is:
A) Empty string should return False since it contains no digits'''
