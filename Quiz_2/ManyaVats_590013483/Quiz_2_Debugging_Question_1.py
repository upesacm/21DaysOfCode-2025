Why other options are wrong:
B) Indexing is not required; iterating over characters is fine in Python.

C) Character comparison works fine in Python as it compares ASCII values internally.

D) Negative numbers (-123) would still contain a '-' character, which is not a digit â€”
but the function is clearly meant to validate only digits, not signed numbers.
