''' 
The logical error is in # Line 1 because a if the string is empty, i.e., "", then it contains no digits, due to which the answer should 
be False but the function returns True which is wrong. Hence, option A) is the correct ansser that : A) Empty string should return False
since it contains no digits.

Corrected version : 

def is_digits_only(s):
    if len(s) == 0:
        return True
    for char in s:
        if char < '0' or char > '9':
            return False
    return True
