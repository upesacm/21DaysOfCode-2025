## 1. K-Frequency Element Sum
A problem that combines frequency counting with conditional summation of distinct elements.

Given an array of integers and an integer `k`, find the **sum of all distinct elements** that appear exactly `k` times in the array. Each such element should be included only once in the sum.

**Your task:** Find the sum of all distinct elements that appear exactly k times in the array.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
nums = [2, 3, 9, 9], k = 1
```
**Output:**
```
5
```
---

**Input:**
```
nums = [1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 6, 2], k = 3
```
**Output:**
```
8
```

## 2. Check for Duplicates
A problem that introduces duplicate detection algorithms and set-based thinking.

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return `true` if any value appears **more than once**, otherwise return `false`.

This problem introduces you to **duplicate detection algorithms** and teaches you about **set-based thinking** and **comparison operations** within arrays.

**Your task:** Return true if any value appears more than once, otherwise return false.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
**Output:**
```
false
```

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [1, 2, 3, 2]
```
**Output:**
```
true
```

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [5, 5, 5]
```
**Output:**
```
true
```

## 3. Find the Second Largest Element
A problem that teaches about finding extremes in data and handling edge cases.

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, find the **second largest unique element** in the array. If it doesn't exist (e.g., all elements are the same), return `-1`.

This problem teaches you about **finding extremes in data** and **handling edge cases** where the desired element might not exist.

**Your task:** Find the second largest unique element in the array, or return -1 if it doesn't exist.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40]
```
**Output:**
```
30
```

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [5, 5, 5]
```
**Output:**
```
-1
```

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [3, 2, 1]
```
**Output:**
```
2
```
