## 1. Simple Array Sorting
A problem that introduces fundamental sorting concepts and demonstrates how to reorganize data efficiently.

You are given an array of integers that are in **random order**. Your task is to write a program that sorts this array in **ascending order** from smallest to largest. You can use any **built-in sorting function** available in your programming language to accomplish this task.

The goal is to understand how to apply **basic sorting operations** to reorganize data efficiently and learn the **fundamental concepts of ordering algorithms**.

**Your task:** Sort an integer array in ascending order using built-in sorting functions.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
[64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
```
**Output:**
```
[11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```

---

**Input:**
```
[5, 2, 8, 6, 1, 9, 4]
```
**Output:**
```
[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9]
```

---

**Input:**
```
[100, 50, 25, 75]
```
**Output:**
```
[25, 50, 75, 100]
```

## 2. Sort by String Length
A problem that demonstrates custom sorting criteria beyond simple numerical or alphabetical ordering.

You have an array of strings with different lengths, and you need to sort them based on their **character count** rather than alphabetical order. Write a program that arranges the strings from **shortest to longest**. If two strings have the same length, **maintain their original relative order**.

This problem helps you understand **custom sorting criteria** and **stable sorting concepts** used in **data organization and text processing applications**.

**Your task:** Sort strings by length while preserving relative order for equal-length strings.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
["apple", "pie", "washington", "cat"]
```
**Output:**
```
["pie", "cat", "apple", "washington"]
```

---

**Input:**
```
["hello", "world", "a", "programming", "fun"]
```
**Output:**
```
["a", "fun", "hello", "world", "programming"]
```

---

**Input:**
```
["java", "python", "c", "javascript"]
```
**Output:**
```
["c", "java", "python", "javascript"]
```

## 3. Bubble Sort Implementation
A problem that teaches the fundamentals of sorting algorithms through hands-on implementation of a classic algorithm.

Implement the **bubble sort algorithm** from scratch to sort an array of integers in ascending order. Bubble sort works by repeatedly stepping through the list, **comparing adjacent elements** and **swapping them** if they are in the wrong order. Continue this process until no more swaps are needed.

This is one of the **simplest sorting algorithms** to understand and implement, making it perfect for learning the **fundamentals of sorting logic** and **algorithm implementation**.

**Your task:** Implement bubble sort algorithm from scratch without using built-in sorting functions.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
[5, 2, 8, 1, 9]
```
**Output:**
```
[1, 2, 5, 8, 9]
```

---

**Input:**
```
[3, 7, 4, 1, 6, 2]
```
**Output:**
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]
```

---

**Input:**
```
[64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
```
**Output:**
```
[11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```
