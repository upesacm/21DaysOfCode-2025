## 1. Find the Minimum Element
A fundamental problem that teaches about finding extremes in data sets using comparison-based algorithms.

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, find and return the **minimum element** in the array.

This is a fundamental problem that teaches you about **finding extremes in data sets** and introduces you to **comparison-based algorithms** that are essential for data analysis and optimization problems.

**Your task:** Find and return the minimum element in the array.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
nums = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9]
```
**Output:**
```
1
```

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [5, 5, 5]
```
**Output:**
```
5
```

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [-3, -1, -5, -2]
```
**Output:**
```
-5
```

## 2. Rotate Array by k Steps
A problem that introduces array manipulation and circular thinking with wraparound scenarios.

Given an array `nums` of size `n` and an integer `k`, **rotate the array to the right** by `k` steps. Return the rotated array.

This problem introduces you to **array manipulation** and **circular thinking**, teaching you how to handle **wraparound scenarios** and **modular arithmetic** in practical applications.

**Your task:** Rotate the array to the right by k steps and return the rotated array.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 2
```
**Output:**
```
[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [10, 20, 30], k = 4
```
**Output:**
```
[30, 10, 20]
```

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [1, 2], k = 1
```
**Output:**
```
[2, 1]
```

## 3. Remove All Occurrences of a Value
A problem that teaches in-place array modification using two-pointer techniques.

Given an array `nums` of size `n` and a value `val`, **remove all occurrences** of `val` from the array. Return the **new length** of the array after removals.

This problem teaches you about **in-place array modification** and introduces concepts of **two-pointer techniques** that are widely used in array manipulation algorithms.

**Your task:** Remove all occurrences of the given value and return the new length of the array.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
nums = [3, 2, 2, 3], val = 3
```
**Output:**
```
2
```
**(new array length after removals)**

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0, 4, 2], val = 2
```
**Output:**
```
5
```

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [1, 1, 1], val = 1
```
**Output:**
```
0
```
