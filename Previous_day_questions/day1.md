## 1. Replace All Negative Numbers with Zero
A basic array manipulation problem that introduces conditional element modification.

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, replace all negative numbers in the array with zero. Return the modified array.

This problem introduces you to **array traversal** and **conditional modification of elements**, which are fundamental skills in array manipulation and data processing.

**Your task:** Replace all negative numbers in the array with zero and return the modified array.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
nums = [-1, 2, -3, 4, 5]
```
**Output:**
```
[0, 2, 0, 4, 5]
```

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [0, -5, -10]
```
**Output:**
```
[0, 0, 0]
```

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
**Output:**
```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## 2. Missing and Repeated
A problem that requires finding a missing number and a duplicate number in an array.

Given an unsorted array of size `n`. Array elements are in the range of `1` to `n`. One number from set `{1, 2, ...n}` is **missing** and one number **occurs twice** in the array. The task is to find these two numbers.

**Your task:** Find the missing number and the number that appears twice in the array.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
[3, 1, 3]
```
**Output:**
```
Missing: 2, Twice: 3
```

---

**Input:**
```
[4, 3, 6, 2, 1, 1]
```
**Output:**
```
Missing: 5, Twice: 1
```

## 3. Sum of Array Elements
A fundamental array operation that calculates the total sum of all elements.

Given an array of integers, write a program that calculates and returns the **sum of all elements** in the array.

This is one of the most fundamental array operations where you need to **traverse through each element** and **accumulate their values**. This type of operation is commonly used in mathematical calculations and data analysis.

**Your task:** Calculate and return the sum of all elements in the array.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
**Output:**
```
15
```

---

**Input:**
```
[10, 20, 30]
```
**Output:**
```
60
```

---

**Input:**
```
[7, 3, 9, 1, 6]
```
**Output:**
```
26
```
