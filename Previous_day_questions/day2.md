## 1. Sum of All Even Numbers
A problem that combines conditional logic with accumulation to filter and sum specific elements.

Given an array of integers `nums` of size `n`, calculate and return the **sum of all even numbers** in the array.

This problem combines **conditional logic** with **accumulation**, teaching you to filter elements based on specific criteria while performing mathematical operations on the filtered data.

**Your task:** Calculate and return the sum of all even numbers in the array.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
**Output:**
```
6
```

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [10, 15, 20]
```
**Output:**
```
30
```

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [1, 3, 5]
```
**Output:**
```
0
```

## 2. Find First and Last Element
A problem that teaches array indexing and accessing elements at specific positions.

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the **first element** and the **last element** of the array as a pair.

This problem teaches you about **array indexing** and how to **access elements at specific positions**, which is fundamental for understanding array boundaries and element positioning.

**Your task:** Return the first and last elements of the array.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
**Output:**
```
First: 1, Last: 4
```

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [7]
```
**Output:**
```
First: 7, Last: 7
```

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [5, 9, 2]
```
**Output:**
```
First: 5, Last: 2
```

## 3. Check if Two Arrays are Equal
A problem that introduces frequency counting and comparison techniques for data structure equality.

Given two arrays, determine if both contain the **same elements with the same frequency**, regardless of their order. Return `true` if they are equal, else return `false`.

This problem introduces you to **frequency counting** and **comparison techniques**, which are essential for understanding how to compare data structures and verify equality beyond simple element-by-element comparison.

**Your task:** Determine if two arrays contain the same elements with the same frequencies.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 4], nums2 = [4, 3, 2, 1]
```
**Output:**
```
true
```
